# Ambulance_services_app
In Recent situation it requires more time to get ambulance service in case of accidental/emrgency situation. The person has to call 108 ,the helpline number.When the user calls to 108 the call is first diverted to the call center and then they ask whole information about the user and the location of user.Then the people there try to find the best hospital at the person location and then send the ambulance to his location.So this process is time consuming.So we are motivated from this scenario and we are developing an android app that will help the user in the accidental situation.So by using  this app the user in accidental/emergency situation will get faster ambulance service, it will be less time consuming and simple to use.any one can use it.
